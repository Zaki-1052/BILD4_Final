# Subjective Feelings of Alcohol Intoxication in Asians with Genetic Variations of *ALDH2* Alleles

## Abstract

Asian-American men who possess *ALDH2*\*2 alleles and who experience a facial flush after consuming alcohol were carefully matched on drinking history and demographic variables with nonflushing Asian males with only *ALDH*2\*1 alleles. Each man was tested following placebo and a challenge dose of 0.75 ml/kg alcohol. Following alcohol, flushers reported experiencing significantly more positive feelings of intoxication than nonflushers, despite equivalent blood alcohol concentrations. These data suggest that Asians who flush after drinking, particularly those with *ALDH*2\*1/2\*2 genotype, have a more intense, although not necessarily a more negative, response to alcohol than comparable nonflushing Asians. This alcohol sensitivity reaction that many Asian flushers experience may contribute to their lower tendency to drink excessively, even though their response to alcohol is not predominantly negative.

## Summary

### Intro

This 1992 study examined how genetic variations in the ALDH2 enzyme affect subjective feelings of alcohol intoxication in Asian men. The research focused on comparing Asian men who experience facial flushing after drinking (due to ALDH2_2 alleles) with non-flushing Asian men (with ALDH2_1 alleles).

### Key Methods:

- 30 healthy male Asian-American university students participated
- Subjects were genetically typed for ALDH2 variants and matched on drinking history/demographics
- Each participant underwent both alcohol (0.75 ml/kg) and placebo sessions
- Measurements included blood alcohol levels, pulse rate, facial flushing, and subjective intoxication ratings

### Key Findings:

- 15 subjects had ALDH2\*2 alleles (14 heterozygotes, 1 homozygote) and showed facial flushing after alcohol
- 15 subjects were ALDH2\*1 homozygotes and showed no flushing
- Blood alcohol concentrations were equivalent between groups
- Flushers showed significantly increased pulse rates up to 120 minutes after drinking
- Flushers reported more intense positive feelings of intoxication (feeling "high," "drunk," "great overall")
- The one ALDH2\*2 homozygote experienced severe adverse reactions

### Important Conclusions:

- ALDH2\*2 heterozygotes appear more sensitive to alcohol but don't necessarily have negative experiences
- Their increased sensitivity may help explain lower rates of excessive drinking, even without predominantly negative reactions
- ALDH2\*2 homozygotes may experience the most severe reactions and are most likely to avoid alcohol
- The study was limited by selecting only subjects who drink regularly, likely underrepresenting ALDH2\*2 homozygotes

### Conclusion

The research challenges previous assumptions that all Asian flushers avoid alcohol due to purely negative reactions, suggesting instead that increased sensitivity itself may be protective against excessive drinking, even when the experience includes positive elements.
