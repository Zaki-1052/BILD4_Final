Alcohol consumption significantly impacts the epigenome, particularly among individuals of Asian ancestry due to specific genetic and epigenetic interactions. One prominent genetic factor is the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism, which influences alcohol metabolism and sensitivity, common in East Asian populations. This genetic variant can exacerbate alcohol-related health risks and interact with epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation alterations at key genomic regions.

Studies have shown that individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD) exhibit widespread epigenetic modifications. In East Asian cohorts, epigenome-wide analyses have identified both hypermethylated and hypomethylated CpG sites, impacting genes linked to neurotransmitter pathways, immune functions, and cellular stress responses. For instance, alterations in DNA methylation were observed at thousands of sites during active alcohol consumption and withdrawal phases, suggesting both immediate and potentially reversible effects of alcohol on the epigenome【7†source】【8†source】.

Furthermore, the methylation changes associated with alcohol use in Asians have been linked to variations in genes regulating alcohol metabolism and tolerance. These epigenetic modifications may contribute to observed phenotypes, such as heightened alcohol flushing and susceptibility to alcohol-related diseases, including liver and cardiovascular conditions【7†source】【8†source】.

Overall, alcohol consumption interacts with genetic predispositions and induces epigenetic changes that can influence health outcomes. Understanding these interactions is critical for developing targeted interventions for populations with specific genetic backgrounds, such as those of Asian ancestry.
