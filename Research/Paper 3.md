# Allergic and asthmatic reactions to alcoholic drinks

## Abstract

Alcoholic drinks are capable of triggering a wide range of allergic and allergic-like responses, including rhinitis, itching, facial swelling, headache, cough and asthma. Limited epidemiological data suggests that many individuals are affected and that sensitivities occur to a variety of drinks, including wine, beer and spirits. In surveys of asthmatics, over 40% reported the triggering of allergic or allergic-like symptoms following alcoholic drink consumption and 30-35% reported worsening of their asthma. Sensitivity to ethanol itself can play a role in triggering adverse responses, particularly in Asians, which is due mainly to a reduced capacity to metabolize acetaldehyde. In Caucasians, specific non-alcohol components are the main cause of sensitivities to alcoholic drinks. Allergic sensitivities to specific components of beer, spirits and distilled liquors have been described. Wine is clearly the most commonly reported trigger for adverse responses. Sensitivities to wine appear to be due mainly to pharmacological intolerances to specific components, such as biogenic amines and the sulphite additives. Histamine in wine has been associated with the triggering of a wide spectrum of adverse symptoms, including sneezing, rhinitis, itching, flushing, headache and asthma. The sulphite additives in wine have been associated with triggering asthmatic responses. Clinical studies have confirmed sensitivities to the sulphites in wine in limited numbers of individuals, but the extent to which the sulphites contribute to wine sensitivity overall is not clear. The aetiology of wine-induced asthmatic responses may be complex and may involve several co-factors.

## Summary

Here is my comprehensive summary of the academic review paper on allergic and asthmatic reactions to alcoholic drinks:

### Intro

This review examines the various allergic and allergic-like responses triggered by alcoholic beverages, including rhinitis, itching, facial swelling, headache, cough, and asthma. Key findings include:

### Epidemiology:

- Over 40% of asthmatics report allergic/allergic-like symptoms from alcoholic drinks
- 30-35% report worsening asthma symptoms
- Wine is the most commonly reported trigger for adverse reactions

### Key Mechanisms:

#### 1. Ethanol Sensitivity:

- More common in Asian populations (up to 50% affected)
- Due to reduced ability to metabolize acetaldehyde
- Symptoms include flushing, vasodilation, rapid heart rate, and bronchial constriction

#### 2. Wine Sensitivity:

- Most common trigger for allergic/asthmatic reactions
- Multiple mechanisms involved:

- Sulphite additives (trigger asthma in 5-10% of asthmatics)
- Biogenic amines (especially histamine and tyramine)
- Possible role of salicylates
- Complex interactions with other factors like unstable asthma

#### 3. Beer and Spirits:

- Fewer documented cases
- Usually due to specific allergens like:

- Cereals (barley, malt)
- Yeast
- Specific additives

### Clinical Presentation:

- Rapid onset of symptoms (usually within 30 minutes)
- Range from mild to severe reactions
- Can be exacerbated by:
	- Unstable asthma
	- Environmental irritants
	- Seasonal allergies

### Research Limitations:

- Most studies focused only on asthmatic populations
- True prevalence in general population unknown
- Complex mechanisms not fully understood
- Need for more research on role of various components

### Conclusion

The review concludes that while alcoholic drink sensitivities are common, especially among asthmatics, the underlying mechanisms are complex and not fully understood. Most reactions appear to be pharmacological intolerances rather than true allergic responses. Healthcare providers and patients should be aware of these potential adverse reactions, particularly regarding wine sensitivity.
