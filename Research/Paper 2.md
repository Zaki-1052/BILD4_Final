## Is Alcohol Use Associated With Cavitary Disease in Tuberculosis?

### Abstract

#### **Background:** 
Alcohol mediates detrimental alterations in the immune response to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. The association between quantity and frequency of alcohol use and the prevalence of cavitary disease in tuberculosis (TB) has not been analyzed. To investigate the relationship of alcohol use and the prevalence of cavitary disease in a 6-year population-based data set of individuals with TB.

#### **Methods:** 
We assessed quantity and frequency of alcohol use (daily alcohol use, years of alcohol use, and lifetime alcohol use) with a standardized questionnaire. The study group consisted of 1,250 patients analyzed for cavitary disease (HIV sero-negative subjects that were 18 years or older). Significant covariates for cavitary disease were entered into multiple logistic regression models.

#### **Results:** 
Although daily alcohol use, years of alcohol use, and alcohol use 30 days or 6 months before symptom onset were significant predictors of cavitary disease in univariate analysis, no independent associations were found between alcohol use and cavitary disease in the multivariate analysis. Only diabetes mellitus was independently associated with cavitary disease at any level or frequency of alcohol use.

#### **Conclusion:** 
Alcohol use is not independently associated with increased prevalence of cavitary disease in adult patients with TB.

## Summary

### Intro

This study investigated whether alcohol consumption is associated with cavitary tuberculosis (TB) disease. The research, conducted by Moran et al., analyzed data from 1,250 HIV-negative adult patients with culture-positive pulmonary TB in Houston, Texas, from 1995-2001.

### Key Findings:

- No independent association was found between alcohol use and cavitary TB disease in multivariate analysis
- This held true regardless of:
	- Daily alcohol consumption
	- Years of alcohol use
	- Alcohol use 30 days or 6 months before symptom onset
- Diabetes mellitus was the only factor independently associated with increased cavitary disease
- Higher education levels were associated with lower rates of cavitary disease

### Methodology:

- Used standardized questionnaires to assess alcohol consumption patterns
- Measured multiple alcohol use metrics:
	- Daily consumption
	- Years of use
	- Lifetime alcohol use
	- Recent use (30 days/6 months before symptoms)
- Excluded HIV-positive patients, those under 18, and cases with incomplete data
- Analyzed various demographic, social, behavioral, and medical history variables

### Important Context:

- Previous studies suggested alcohol could increase TB severity through immune system effects
- Alcohol affects T-lymphocytes and cell-mediated immune response
- The lack of association between alcohol and cavitary disease may be explained by alcohol's reduction of TNF-α levels in alveolar fluid

### Study Limitations:

- Did not evaluate other indicators of disease severity
- Did not assess treatment adherence or response
- Focused solely on cavitary disease as measure of severity

### Conclusion

The research concludes that while alcohol use may increase TB risk and mortality, it does not independently increase the likelihood of developing cavitary TB disease. This finding challenges some previous assumptions about alcohol's role in TB disease progression and severity.
