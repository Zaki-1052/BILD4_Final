# Epigenetic Relationship

## Methylation and ALDH2 Variant Connection

### 1. Genetic Foundation:
- The ALDH2\*rs671 variant is a fixed genetic difference
- This variant causes reduced ALDH2 enzyme activity
- Result: Less efficient acetaldehyde breakdown
### 2. Methylation Impact:
- When acetaldehyde accumulates (due to the variant)
- It interferes with DNA methyltransferases
- These enzymes normally maintain proper DNA methylation patterns
- Result: Disrupted methylation across many genes
### 3. Process
```
Alcohol → Acetaldehyde
↓
ALDH2 variant can't clear acetaldehyde efficiently
↓
Acetaldehyde builds up
↓
Accumulated acetaldehyde interferes with methylation enzymes
↓
Widespread changes in DNA methylation
↓
Altered gene expression patterns
```
### Conclusion:
The variant affects the enzyme's function, which leads to acetaldehyde buildup, which then disrupts normal methylation patterns. This creates a cascade effect where the initial genetic variation leads to broader epigenetic changes, which we would like to study.
