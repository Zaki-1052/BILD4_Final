# Hypothesis Research

## Explanation

### Research Foundation

- Previous research demonstrates that individuals with Asian ancestry show increased ethanol sensitivity and reduced capacity to metabolize acetaldehyde. This is primarily due to a specific genetic variant in the ALDH2 gene, which manifests as the Asian glow phenomenon.

### Novel Hypothesis

- We hypothesize that this genetic predisposition leads to a more complex cascade of biological effects beyond just the visible flush response. Specifically:
#### 1. Primary Mechanism:
- Acetaldehyde accumulation occurs due to reduced ALDH2 enzyme activity
- This reduces conversion to acetate (normal metabolic pathway)
#### 2. Epigenetic Effects (Our Key Theoretical Contribution):
- Accumulated acetaldehyde interferes with DNA methyltransferases
- This disrupts one-carbon metabolism (the biochemical process that provides methyl groups for DNA modification)
- Results in widespread DNA hypomethylation across the genome
#### 3. Cascading Impact:
- Reduced methylation affects:  
	a) Alcohol metabolism genes (further reducing processing capability)  
	b) Neural pathway genes (enhancing alcohol sensitivity)
- Creates a potential feedback loop of increased sensitivity

### Practical Predictions

- When we compare our experimental group (Asian individuals with the ALDH2 variant) to our control group, we expect to observe:
	- Higher blood alcohol concentrations
	- Enhanced feelings of intoxication
	- Reduced DNA methylation patterns  
	    These three factors will likely reinforce each other, creating a more pronounced response to alcohol consumption.
### Conclusion

- The epigenetic dysregulation will be shown in Asian individuals with the ALDH2 variant due to an accumulation of acetaldehyde because of a lack of metabolism of ethanol to acetate, leading to hypomethylation when it interferes with DNA methyltransferases, so that individuals with Asian ancestry become more sensitive to alcohol in their epigenome, finally leading to increased frequency of the Asian glow phenomenon and higher intoxication levels.
