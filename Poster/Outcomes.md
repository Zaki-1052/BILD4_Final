# Possible Outcomes

## Support

### Hypothesis Supported

P-value: < 0.05 There is a significant difference between the consumption and effects of alcohol in Asian and non-Asian groups. In this case, the negative groups are those who have an absence of aldehyde dehydrogenase allele which means that the body will feel the effects of alcohol more which will result in being in a flushed state. Since there is a significant difference, Asian groups will feel the effects of alcohol more than non-Asians since they have a reduced ALDH2 enzyme activity.

## Rejected

### Hypothesis Not Supported

P-Value: > 0.05. There is not a significant difference between the consumption and effects of alcohol in Asian and non-Asian groups. Both groups experience the same effects of alcohol and is not related to the aldehyde dehydrogenase allele. In this case, the Asian ancestry does not have a higher sensitivity to alcohol and its effect but rather is the same across various racial groups.
