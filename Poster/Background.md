# Background

A red glow when consuming alcohol is seen amongst a wide range of individuals. However, it is primarily prominent in the Asian population, thus naming the phenomenon “Asian glow”. Though alcohol itself is capable of instigating allergic reactions such as headaches, swelling, itchiness, and asthma in any consumer, due to ethanol sensitivity, Asians are particularly affected due to a reduced capacity to metabolize acetaldehyde [1]

This experiment compares the effects of alcohol with the presence and absence of an aldehyde dehydrogenase allele in Asian-American men. The direct comparison allows not only an analysis of physical feelings of intoxication but also analysis of blood alcohol levels after consuming equal amounts of alcohol. [2]
