### Epigenome

-  Ask how epigenome is affected by alcohol consumption for individuals with asian ancestry
	- We're defining the epigenome here as the collection of chemical modifications to our DNA that control gene expression -- specifically methylation of DNA from the lack of enzymes meant to metabolize and catalyze toxic chemicals from ethanol products.

## Background Elements (from Papers 3 & 4):

### 1. Asian Glow Phenomenon  
- Immediate visible reaction to alcohol  
- Affects 30-50% of East Asian population  
- Key indicator of underlying genetic variation
### 2. Genetic Basis (Paper 4):  
- Two distinct groups: flushers vs. non-flushers  
- Tied to specific genetic variants  
- Blood alcohol concentrations remain equal between groups  
- Different subjective experiences
### 3. Metabolic Mechanism (Paper 3):  
- Normal pathway: Alcohol → Acetaldehyde → Acetate  
- Asian populations: Acetaldehyde accumulation  
- Results in broader range of symptoms:
    - Facial flushing
    - Increased heart rate
    - Enhanced sensitivity
    - Various allergic-like responses
### 4. Key Setup for Hypothesis:  
- Established genetic predisposition  
- Clear physiological response  
- Observable differences in alcohol processing  
- Links to broader biological impacts
### 5. [[Epigenetic Relationship]]
- ALDH2 Variant -->
	- Increased acetaldehyde accumulation
		- Disrupts DNA Methylation
			- Leads to: 
				- increased alcohol sensitivity

### Conclusion: 

- This is the reason for the Asian glow, as well as many of the effects in our research papers, but we'll be predicting further epigenetic changes due to various biological processes.
