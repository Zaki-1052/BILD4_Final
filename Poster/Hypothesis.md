# Hypothesis

Individuals of [[Asian ancestry]] who [[consume high levels of alcohol]] will experience more extensive [[DNA hypomethylation]] across their [[epigenome]] compared to other populations, particularly in [[genes controlling alcohol metabolism]] and [[neural pathways]], due to their [[genetic predisposition for acetaldehyde accumulation]] through the [[ALDH2*rs671 variant]]. This enhanced [[epigenetic modification]] occurs because [[acetaldehyde]], which will [[accumulate at higher levels in Asian individuals]] due to [[reduced ALDH2 enzyme activity]], inhibits [[DNA methyltransferases]] and disrupts [[one-carbon metabolism]], leading to more [[epigenetic dysregulation]]. Practically speaking, this will mean that when we test the [[blood-alcohol concentration]] and [[methylation patterns]] in the blood and compare it with our [[control group]], we will see that there are [[high levels of methylation]] and [[greater effects of alcohol]] in our [[experimental group]] in terms of [[intoxication and alcohol sensitivity]]. This is the main cause of the phenomenon known as the [[Asian glow]]. Read more about why this is in the [[Background]].
