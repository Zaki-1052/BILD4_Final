# Practice Q&A

## Questions

### Question 1

#### 1. Research Question & Hypothesis:

Q: "How does your hypothesis specifically connect the ALDH2 variant to epigenetic changes?"
Strong Answer: "The ALDH2 variant reduces the enzyme's ability to break down acetaldehyde. We hypothesize that accumulated acetaldehyde interferes with DNA methyltransferases, leading to widespread hypomethylation, particularly affecting genes involved in alcohol metabolism and neural pathways. This creates a reinforcing cycle of increased sensitivity."

### Question 2

#### 2. Methods & Controls:

- Q: "Why did you choose 0.75 ml/kg as your alcohol dose, and how does your control group account for potential confounding variables?"
	- Strong Answer: "We selected 0.75 ml/kg based on previous studies showing this dose reliably produces measurable effects while remaining safe. Our control group matches all demographics except the ALDH2 variant, allowing us to isolate the genetic component's influence on methylation patterns."

### Question 3

#### 3. Experimental Design:

- Q: "How will you distinguish between methylation changes caused by the ALDH2 variant versus other factors?"
	- Strong Answer: "We'll take baseline methylation measurements before alcohol administration and compare changes between groups. Since both groups experience the same conditions except for the genetic variant, significant differences in methylation patterns can be attributed to the ALDH2 variant's effects."

### Question 4

#### 4. Technical Understanding:

- Q: "Can you explain how one-carbon metabolism connects to your hypothesis?"
	- Strong Answer: "One-carbon metabolism provides the methyl groups needed for DNA methylation. When acetaldehyde accumulates due to reduced ALDH2 activity, it disrupts this process by interfering with DNA methyltransferases, leading to hypomethylation. This connects the genetic variant to broader epigenetic effects."

### Question 5

#### 5. Limitations & Future Directions:

- Q: "What are the main limitations of your study design?"
	- Strong Answer: "Our current design is limited to male UCSD students aged 21-25, which affects generalizability. Future studies could expand to include female participants, different age groups, and various ethnic subgroups to better understand how these factors influence the relationship between the ALDH2 variant and epigenetic changes."

### Question 6

#### 6. Research Impact:

- Q: "How might your findings contribute to our understanding of alcohol use disorder in Asian populations?"
	- Strong Answer: "Our research could reveal how genetic variants influence epigenetic mechanisms in alcohol sensitivity. This could help explain why some Asian populations have different risks for alcohol use disorder and potentially lead to more targeted prevention strategies or treatments."
