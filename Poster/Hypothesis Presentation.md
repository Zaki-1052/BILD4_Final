# HYPOTHESIS PRESENTATION

## Opening:  
• Asian glow + ALDH2 variant → broader biological effects  
• Predicting increased alcohol sensitivity via epigenetic cycle
## Mechanism:  
• Asian ancestry + ALDH2\*rs671 variant = ↓ enzyme activity  
• Result: DNA hypomethylation across epigenome  
• Cause: Acetaldehyde disrupts DNA methyltransferases  
• Affects: Alcohol metabolism + neural pathway genes
## Predictions:  
• 3 Main Effects vs Controls:
1. ↑ Blood alcohol levels
2. ↑ Intoxication feelings
3. ↓ DNA methylation  
    • Creates reinforcing sensitivity cycle
## Conclusion:  
• Explains visible + molecular effects  
• Links genetic predisposition → epigenetic response  
• If null hypothesis false = significant connection found
