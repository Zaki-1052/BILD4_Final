## Front Flashcard

### Hypothesis:

#### 1. Beyond Asian Glow
- ALDH2 variant → acetaldehyde buildup
- Not just visible symptoms
- Deeper biological cascade

#### 2. Mechanism Chain
- ↓ALDH2 activity
- ↑acetaldehyde accumulation
- Interferes w/methyltransferases
- Disrupts DNA methylation

#### 3. Expected Outcomes
- ↑Blood alcohol levels
- ↑Intoxication feelings
- ↓DNA methylation
- Reinforcing cycle

## Back Flashcard

### KEY MECHANISMS & SUPPORT:

#### DNA Methylation Process:
• One-carbon metabolism provides methyl groups
• DNA methyltransferases attach -CH3 to DNA
• Controls gene expression/regulation

#### ALDH2\*rs671 Details:
• Common in 35-45% East Asians
• Glu504Lys protein change
• 40% reduced efficiency (heterozygous)
• Near-zero activity (homozygous)

#### Research Support:
• Paper 1: Genetic risk variants → AUD connection
• Paper 3: Alcohol sensitivity mechanism
• Paper 4: Flushing response data

#### Experimental Design:
• Control: Non-variant carriers
• Experimental: ALDH2*rs671 carriers
• Measuring: BAC, methylation, symptoms
