# Hypothesis Presentation 

## Speaking Points

### Opening
- As an extension of what we know about the Asian glow phenomenon and its connection to the ALDH2 genetic variant, our hypothesis theorizes beyond the visible symptoms to predict a domino effect of biological processes and an epigenetic cycle that leads to increased alcohol sensitivity overall in our experimental group compared to the control.

### Main Mechanism
- We think that individuals with Asian ancestry experiencing reduced ALDH2 enzyme activity due to the ALDH2\*rs671 genetic variant will show more extensive DNA hypomethylation across their epigenome. This occurs because accumulated acetaldehyde interferes with DNA methyltransferases, disrupting normal methylation patterns, especially in genes controlling both alcohol metabolism and neural pathways.

### Predictions
- In practical terms, when comparing our experimental group to controls, we expect to observe three interconnected effects: higher blood alcohol concentrations, enhanced feelings of intoxication, and reduced DNA methylation patterns. And these factors will likely create a reinforcing cycle of increased alcohol sensitivity.

### Conclusion
- This mechanism would explain both the immediate visible effects of alcohol consumption in Asian individuals, and give an explanation on a molecular level for their enhanced sensitivity to alcohol through epigenetic modifications. If our null hypothesis is false, it would show that there is a significant connection between genetic predisposition and epigenetic response.
