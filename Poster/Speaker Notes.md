# Hypothesis Presentation

## Paragraph:

So as we've seen from past ethanol sensitivity in Asian individuals in the background of Paper 3, and their reduced capacity to metabolize the acetaldehyde product of alcohol, which is due to a genetic ALDH2 variant, we hypothesize that this will not just result in in the Asian glow flush. 

Our hypothesis is that when we study the sensitivity to alcohol based on blood alcohol concentration, feelings of intoxication, and DNA methylation, that because acetaldehyde will accumulate and reduce enzyme activity, thus making, as we know, less acetate conversion, we'll also -- theoretically -- see less DNA methyltransferases and thus less carbon metabolism -- which provides the methyl groups needed for DNA modification, and, when disrupted, it reduces the cell's ability to maintain proper gene regulation).

Also, as supported in Paper 1 that these genetic risk variants are common in Alcohol Use Disorder, -- which shows that these pathways are indeed involved in alcohol response and sensitivity, then we'll see hypo, or less methylation across the genome, which will lead to less active ability to metabolize alcohol. It will also mean an enhanced response to alcohol in the neural pathways due to the reduced gene expression and general epigenetic dysregulation once acetaldehyde builds up. 

The implication here would be that in our experimental group, this would spiral in Asians who have this genetic variant, and they'll have greater BAC concentrations, feelings of intoxication, and less methylation, which would increase the previous two points. And theoretically, our control group will gain less sensitivity to alcohol and grow less intoxicated when we compare the rate of change of methylation across their genomes and their blood concentrations.

## [[Research Explanation]]

- The epigenetic dysregulation will be shown in Asian individuals with the ALDH2 variant due to an accumulation of acetaldehyde because of a lack of metabolism of ethanol to acetate, leading to hypomethylation when it interferes with DNA methyltransferases, so that individuals with Asian ancestry become more sensitive to alcohol in their epigenome, finally leading to increased frequency of the Asian glow phenomenon and higher intoxication levels.
