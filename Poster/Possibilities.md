## **Future Directions**

In our study, we measured the BAC amongst UCSD male students. As a result, one could only apply our results to the male student population of UCSD. In future studies, one could expand on this research by replicating our study for other demographics. For example, one could compare if the determined relationship holds true for female UCSD students. Or, one could compare to see if the results differ with age, accounting for how our results only included ages 21-25 years old.
