## Outcomes Speaking Points

### Hypothesis Support Scenario (P < 0.05):
- Significant differences between Asian and non-Asian groups
- Key indicators:
  • Higher sensitivity in ALDH2 variant carriers
  • Stronger flush response
  • Methylation pattern differences
- Validates genetic influence on alcohol processing

### Null Result Scenario (P > 0.05):
- No significant group differences
- Would suggest:
  • Similar alcohol effects across populations
  • ALDH2 variant may not impact methylation
  • Need to explore other mechanisms
