## Methods Speaking Points

### Setup & Design:
- We recruited 30 UCSD male students, ages 21-25
- Key focus: Controlled environment & consistent demographics
- Careful screening process to eliminate confounding health factors

### Procedure Flow:
- Start with baseline blood work for ADH2 levels
- Randomized placebo vs. alcohol administration
- Standard dose: 0.75 ml/kg alcohol
- Comprehensive measurements at 15-30 minute intervals:
  • Blood alcohol levels
  • Physical responses (pulse, flushing)
  • Subjective intoxication reports

### Analysis Approach:
- Two-factor variance analysis
- Comparing experimental vs. control groups
- Looking for statistically significant differences
